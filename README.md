This repo shouldn't really have NER (Named Entity Recognition) in the title. 

What it really does is all allow a user to ask an LLM (via API) a question about an MPs last 500ish tweets (hardcoded currently to just one MP and one set of tweets currently).

Streamlit is used to provide front-end / UI.

You will need an Anthropic API key.
