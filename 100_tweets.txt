I know that people across Coventry – and especially in the city’s South Asian community – are very concerned at reports of a research study that took place in Coventry in the 1960s, where 21 South Asian women were fed chapatis containing radioactive iron salts.

My statement:A joy to join the Teenvine Plus Summer Festival yesterday, celebrating a successful year of the youth-led project that promotes independence and prevents isolation for young people with special educational needs and disabilities.

Thank you for the invite, @GrapevineCandW! 😊When workers wanted pay rises to match soaring living costs, Tory ministers told them to accept "pay restraint" to combat inflation.

Now FTSE 100 bosses get a 16% pay rise – taking average pay to £3,900,000 – and Tory ministers are silent.

That tells you whose side they're on.Absolutely gutted for the @Lionesses 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 

The journey to our first women’s World Cup final was inspiring; we’ll get the job done next time! 🙏🏽🦁Congratulations Lola! Looking forward to meeting you! 🌹This is disgusting, @ManUtd.

I will always stand in solidarity with survivors of domestic violence, so consider me “hostile”.Congratulations with everyone getting A Level results today – and I'm looking forward to meeting those who are going to Warwick and Coventry universities! 🥳FINAL, HERE WE COME! 🦁🦁🦁It was a pleasure to join Earlsdon Labour members at the weekend for a Summer Social, catching-up and chatting about plans for the future.

Thank you to everyone who came along! 🙌🏽I love celebrating Coventry's diverse communities and this weekend I had the opportunity to attend the annual feast celebrations at Coventry Greek Orthodox Church.

It was great to again be part of the day! 😊Oppenheimer verdict: 

Weapons of mass destruction bad; Cillian Murphy good.Access to abortion is a fundamental right, and it must be defended from constant attack.

That's why it was so valuable to visit the British Pregnancy Advisory Service clinic in Coventry last week, which provides this essential healthcare service for those in the city and beyond.What a nerve-wracking game against Nigeria!

Brilliant penalty performance by England’s @Lionesses; bring on the quarter-finals! 🦁 #WomensWorldCupThe Bibby Stockholm was built to house 220 people, but the Tories want it to house 500+ people seeking asylum.

The Fire Brigades Union has warned it's a "potential death trap", while a report said it could be a "floating Grenfell".

That tells you how callous the Tories are.Rishi Sunak approved 100+ new oil and gas licenses just weeks after the 3 hottest ever recorded days.

History will judge this climate vandalism as a gross moral crime.British Gas just reported record profits: £969,000,000 in 6 months, nearly 10x what it made last year.

Your sky-high bills are their obscene profits.

It's time to bring energy into public ownership, running it to meet your needs, not their greed.Had to jump on the #Barbie-wagon!With deadly forest fires, devastating floods and record-breaking temperatures recorded, remember:

Just 100 companies are responsible for 71% of global emissions.

Only bold state-led policy – beginning with a Green New Deal – can avert climate catastrophe.That’s terrifying! Hope you’re okay, Aaron. Sending lots of love and solidarity!The rain might have moved it indoors this year, but it was still a joy to bring together Labour members and supporters in Coventry South this weekend for my annual summer picnic, catching up and having fun 🥰I visited my old primary school last week, Anglesey Primary School, where 4 in 10 children grow up in poverty.

I want to live in a country where no-one is held back by poverty.

That's why I firmly believe we should scrap the two-child limit.The two-child limit is an unspeakably cruel policy, inflicting destitution and misery on children and parents.

It absolutely should be abolished.If you're able to, you can help out here, supporting @SewaDay's School Hamper Campaign:
justgiving.com/fundraising/s…4.2 million children are living in poverty in the UK and we can't just wait around for political change to tackle that injustice.

So in Coventry, this week we were putting solidarity into action, collecting food for the school holidays, helping kids and families over the summer.Junior doctors' pay has fallen by 26% since 2008.

In that same time, UK billionaires saw a decade where their wealth went up £438,000,000,000.

So don't let anyone tell you there's not enough money for a fair pay rise.

That's why today I again stood with striking doctors 👊🏽Incredibly brave of my friend and colleague @ApsanaBegumMP to speak out again about her experiences.

Like @jessphillips says in response here, the way she has been treated is "a disgrace".

Solidarity Apsana 🤍The plan to close 1,000 ticket offices is an attack on workers and passengers.

Train operators and the Tories are running our railways into the ground, focused on cutting costs and protecting profits.

My letter to the Transport Secretary, calling on him to #SaveTicketOfficesYou can watch the full speech here:
facebook.com/ZarahSultanaMP/…This isn't a cost-of-living crisis because there's not enough wealth.

It's a crisis because they're hoarding all the wealth!

From my speech at the Durham Miners' Gala:Great to speak alongside trade union leaders including the TUC General Secretary Paul Nowak, the Bakers’ Union General Secretary Sarah Woolley, and PCS President Fran Heathcote.An incredible honour to speak at the Durham Miners Gala today.

In my speech, I committed to stand with workers fighting for their rights. 

And 75 years after Nye Bevan spoke at the Gala having just founded the NHS, I promised to defend that historic achievement.This morning I stood alongside teachers on strike in Coventry, as they fight for fair pay and better funding for our schools.

Solidarity with our teachers! 💕75 years ago today Labour created the NHS.

Publicly owned universal healthcare, free at the point of use – it became the envy of the world.

But underfunding and creeping privatisation have left it on its knees.

We must fight to save the NHS and restore its founding principles.Our NHS was founded 75 years ago with a socialist principle at its heart:

Publicly owned, universal healthcare, with access determined by need, not wealth.

This weekend at the @SocialistHealth Association #NHS75 conference, I committed to defending and renewing that principle.Full text version here: facebook.com/ZarahSultanaMP/…Tonight MPs voted on the Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Foreign Matters) Bill, commonly known as the Anti-Boycott Bill.

Due to a long-standing family commitment, I was unable to be in Parliament.

Nonetheless, I want to put on record my opposition to this Bill:Sign-up to join us: actionnetwork.org/events/nhs…Our NHS was founded 75 years ago on the principle of publicly owned healthcare for all, from cradle to grave.

Today, that principle needs defending.

That's why I'm proud to be joining healthcare workers, policy experts and campaigners at the SHA NHS75 conference tomorrow.Every child should have access to a hot, healthy meal each school lunchtime, allowing pupils to eat, learn and grow together.

That's why I support #FreeSchoolMealsForAll!

coventrytelegraph.net/news/c…Suella Braverman says she "dreams" of deporting refugees to Rwanda.

I hope today's court ruling puts an end to that dream.

But the courts alone can't defeat Braverman's politics.

The only thing that will is a powerful pro-refugee, anti-racist movement.

Let's build it 👊🏽Today I joined colleagues and campaigners to hand-in a letter to the Prime Minister, calling on him to bring in #FreeSchoolMealsForAll, with signatures from 240+ civil society leaders (from @SadiqKhan to @GaryLineker) and 90,000 people.

Let's make this happen! 💪🏽Eid Mubarak to everyone celebrating! 

Wishing you and your loved ones a joyous and blessed celebration filled with laughter, love and togetherness! 💛

nitter.net/khadljasays/stat…Since the water industry was privatised, infrastructure investment has fallen by 15%, company debt has soared, and shareholders have been handed £72,000,000,000 in dividends.

Private interests have been put before the public good.

It's time to bring water into public ownership.Access to clothing is a basic right, but many more people are struggling to have this need met due to the cost-of-living crisis.

That's why I am so grateful to Clothing Coventry, a charity providing clothes to people in need in the city. On Friday I dropped off items to them 🤍Massive congratulations Gary, this is thoroughly deserved! 👏🏽Today marks 75 years since the Windrush generation arrived in the UK, & I was proud to mark the occasion in Coventry.

We can never forget the huge contributions they made or the injustices they continue to face. On #WindrushDay we recommit ourselves to fighting for full justice.This afternoon I joined parents & children of Coventry University Nursery to hand in a petition to stop a proposed closure.

No-one should be locked out of work or education due to access to childcare — so we call on @covcampus to do the right thing & secure the nursery’s future.Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest affects 80,000 people per year and is the ultimate medical emergency – but the UK doesn’t formal care plans to support those who go through it.
 
I joined @ResusCouncilUK earlier this week to support everyone’s right to #CardiacArrestRecovery.Great to meet up with Coventry @NEUnion members lobbying MPs to #SaveOurSchools.

From underpaid & overworked teachers, to oversized classes & paltry free school meals, the funding crisis in schools is failing staff & students, parents & the public. 

We need serious action now.Today, at the beginning of #RefugeeWeek, I joined @Barnardos to hear about the work they do to welcome child refugees and asylum seekers in Britain.

Instead of turning our backs on people who have fled war and persecution, we should show them love and compassion 🤍Groundwork is a charity focused on tackling poverty and promoting environmentalism. 

In Coventry South they've combined these two objectives by improving the energy efficiency of people's homes – cutting bills and carbon.

It was great to hear all about it from Jo today.This morning I had the pleasure of joining the Albany Theatre, hearing about their plans for the future and the exciting activities they have coming up.

Looking forward to more excellent shows and performances!At least 78 people have died & hundreds more are missing after a boat sank off the coast of Greece this week.

They wanted to rebuild their lives in Europe, but inhumane border policies deny safe routes to refugees.

These tragic deaths are the predictable result of that cruelty.Amazon workers in Coventry made history by launching the first ever strike at the company in the UK.

They're now fighting the company's dirty tricks to prevent union recognition.

In Parliament today I spoke to these brave @GMB_Union members, again giving them my full support ✊🏽Six years ago today 72 people burned to death in Grenfell Tower.

They were killed by greed and neglect, but still no-one has been held to account.

We also recognise the bravery of the firefighters that attended that tragic night.

Justice for Grenfell 💚 #72months72livesYou can sign the online petition here: 

change.org/p/save-coventry-u…Coventry University is threatening to close its nursery, a move that would have a devastating impact for staff, students and the wider community.

In Parliament last night, I presented a petition launched by parents that calls on the university to reconsider its plans.After 13 years of Tory rule, we have seen the decimation of our public services, a decline in living standards & the ever-spiralling cost-of-living crisis pushing millions into poverty.

So yes: good riddance to Boris Johnson, but it’s not enough. We need to get rid of them all.Happy #PrideMonth to the LGBT+ community in Coventry South and across the country! 🌈 

The struggle for LGBT+ equality has come a long way, but there’s still so much work to do. That’s why I’m proud to add my name in support of @NadiaWhittomeMP’s EDM:Solidarity with @NUJofficial members at @BBCCWR and across the country on strike to protect jobs and to defend a much loved and valued service.

Local radio is the lifeblood of our communities and vital to local democracy. These cuts must be resisted. #KeepBBCLocalRadioLocalI’m devastated by this news. @BethWinterMP has consistently used her platform to stand up for working class communities and the labour movement. An absolute talent, and one of the kindest people you’ll find in politics.

Love and solidarity, always 🩷Solidarity, Jamie. Like many others from across the Labour Party, I’m shocked by this news. 

Your record as Mayor for the North East region speaks for itself — and Labour members should have an opportunity to vote for you. I hope this decision is reversed.Such an honour to meet Chris, Gerald & Jordan of @amazonlabor in Coventry  last night & hear about their historic win to become the first union for Amazon workers in the US.

From Coventry to New York, the movement to win dignity & respect for Amazon workers is international ✊🏽Absolutely gutted for @Coventry_City. Penalties are a cruel way to lose after a fantastic performance and a season to be incredibly proud of.

Bring on next season! 💙 #PUSBIn Parliament today, I raised the threatened closure of Coventry University Nursery, a vital service to staff, students and the wider community.

I'm calling on the university to listen to parents, nursery staff, and trade unions and to save the nursery.Coventry University has threatened to close its much-loved nursery, a move that could force staff and students to leave their jobs and degrees.

Parents and unions are calling on the university to instead work towards the nursery's survival. Join them:
change.org/p/save-coventry-u…Migrants don't rob the public purse of billions of pounds.

That's super-rich tax dodgers.

Migrants don't drive down wages & jack-up rents.

That's greedy bosses & wealthy landlords.

And migrants don't underfund schools & hospitals.

That's a Tory government working for the 1%.Extending free school meals to all pupils helps tackle poverty, reduce educational inequality, and improve children's health.

The case for it is overwhelming, as was again made clear at @ChildrensFood's event in Parliament today.

That's why I #SayYes to school food for all!It's been a cost-of-living crisis for the many, but a bonanza for the few.

Corporate profiteering – not wage rises – is driving inflation, and that's what needs to be tackled.Tonight MPs vote on the Tories' Anti-Strike Bill.

This Bill attacks the rights of the working class and would see nurses sacked for striking for fair pay.

Ahead of votes, I joined colleagues at @the_TUC demonstration outside Parliament to show our support for the #RightToStrikeAround 70,000 people in the UK have muscular dystrophy, but many don't receive all the support they need.

That's why the work of Muscular Dystrophy Support Centre, a charity based in Coventry, is so important, as I heard this weekend at their 10th anniversary celebration.Beth is a fantastic MP, a committed champion for social justice, and a genuinely kind and caring person.

She's standing to be the Labour candidate for the new Merthyr Tydfil and Upper Cynon constituency and she has my full support.Fantastic doorknocking session in sunny Hillfields this afternoon, speaking to Coventry South residents and picking-up casework.

As always, big up @WarwickLabour for the support! 💕The Museum of Me celebrates the lives of ordinary people in Coventry, showcasing their stories and meaningful objects.

Today, the museum celebrated Fraser, a scout leader and Cheylesmore resident.

Thank you for inviting me, @TheMuseumOfMe1!AbdulHadi al-Khawaja is a political prisoner, locked-up by Bahrain's regime for championing democracy.

This week I met his daughter @MaryamAlkhawaja, who campaigns for his freedom & for all Bahrainis unjustly imprisoned.

Our government must echo her call & promote human rights.What a result for @Coventry_City! The Sky Blues are going to Wembley! Just one win away from the Premier League! 🚀🙌🏽 #PUSBTeachers are leaving the profession in droves and it's no mystery why: Pay is down 13% since 2010 and overtime is way up.

That's why, in a parliamentary debate I secured last week, I called for an inflation-busting pay deal for teachers and lecturers.
coventrytelegraph.net/news/c…Today marks 75 years since the Nakba, when 750,000+ Palestinians were violently expelled from their homes.

The Nakba continues to this day, with Palestinians facing dispossession and violence on a daily basis.

Together, let's recommit ourselves to a free Palestine.Our schools and colleges are in crisis – and it's no mystery why: Funding has been cut, with teachers' pay falling even as workloads rise.

Pupils and educators are being failed.

That's why this week I led a debate in Parliament on school and college funding in the Midlands:I echo the deep concerns expressed by many others regarding the deteriorating situation in Pakistan and the violent arrest of former Prime Minister Imran Khan. 

Elections in Pakistan must be free, fair and transparent.

Democracy, the rule of law and human rights must be upheld.Really grateful to teachers from the Midlands who visited Westminster yesterday to support my debate on the crisis in our education system.

Primary class sizes are the largest in Europe. 1 in 4 teachers leave within 3 years of qualification. 

Teachers & students deserve better.Fantastic to join trade unionists across the West Midlands last weekend and show our solidarity with @RMTunion members who have renewed their mandate for strike action. 

✊🏽 if you’re able to, please support the RMT Strike Fund: rmt.org.uk/about/national-di…Access to healthcare is a basic human right, yet communication barriers mean many Deaf people are routinely denied this.

That’s what I was told during my visit to Coventry & Warwickshire Association for the Deaf, & I’ll be working with CWAD to address these inequalities locally.It is deeply disturbing that organisers of the #NotMyKing protest in London have been arrested this morning, before the protest even began.

Whatever you think of the monarchy, the right to peaceful protest is fundamental to democracy.

This is a chilling violation of that right.Huge congrats Rahima! 🙌🏽Huge congratulations to Labour councillors elected and re-elected in Coventry and across the country! 

More than anything else, these results show that people are sick and tired of 13 years of disastrous Tory rule.

Booting them out of power can't happen soon enough 👊🏽A great session in Cheylesmore, knocking on doors, reminding people that they have until 10pm to vote — and that they now need to take ID!We're out in Westwood, helping to beat the Tories and win for Labour 🙏🏽🌹Aww, it was lovely to bump into you and Bow this afternoon! ☀️🌹Today is Firefighters Memorial Day, where we remember the 2,300+ brave firefighters who have lost their lives in the line of duty.

To mark the day, I tabled this Early Day Motion, paying tribute to their courage and commitment.Good morning knocking on doors in Binley and Willenhall, getting out the Labour vote in Coventry and sending a message to this rotten Tory government.

Polls are open until 10pm and don't forget to take your photo ID to the polling station!The local elections on Thursday are the first time people in England will need photo ID to vote.

If you've lost your ID, you can apply for an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm on polling day to have your voice heard:All too often our transport system is inaccessible to disabled people, denying opportunities and creating unnecessary barriers.

That's why the work of the National Centre for Accessible Transport – launched recently at Coventry University – is vital, as I saw on a recent visit.A City of Sanctuary, Coventry has a proud tradition of welcoming migrants & refugees.

That was on display last week at a Student Action for Refugees event at Warwick Medical School, where I joined local migrant groups & students to speak about the Tories' anti-refugee policies.Aww congratulations Ash (and Joe), such wonderful news! 🎀🌸✨An absolute pleasure to join Coventry’s Sikh community this afternoon for the 35th annual Vaisakhi Sports Day at War Memorial Park.

Thank you to the organisers and congratulations to everyone who competed and won! 🏆✨A brilliant result for the Sky Blues this afternoon and three HUGE points. The Championship play-offs are in sight! 💙 #PUSBGood to be out campaigning in Cheylesmore today ahead of the local elections, knocking on doors and picking up casework ☺️The Tories have gone from clapping nurses to dragging them through the courts. Shameful.

Solidarity with our nurses! 💙Teachers are striking today for fair pay, for investment in our schools, and for our children's future.

It was an honour to join Coventry teachers this morning, showing my support for them in their fight.

Solidarity!
